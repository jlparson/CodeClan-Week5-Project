# CodeClan-Week5-Project
Travel Bucket List is an app that tracks a user's travel adventures, including marking destinations as visited or as wanting to visit. It was built in one week as a CodeClan solo project using Python, Flask, PostgreSQL, HTML and CSS.

MVP:
The app should allow the user to track countries and cities they want to visit and those they have visited.
The user should be able to create and edit countries.
Each country should have one or more cities to visit.
The user should be able to create and delete entries for cities.
The app should allow the user to mark destinations as visited or still to see.

Possible Extensions:
Have separate pages for destinations visited and those still to visit.
Add sights to the destination cities.
Search for destination by continent, city or country.
Any other ideas you might come up with.

What I learned:

-Object oriented programming with Python

-Test Driven Development

-Web Programming (REST, MVC)

-Interacting with a PostgreSQL database (CRUD)
